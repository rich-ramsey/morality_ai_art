This project is the aesthetics morality project with Ionela and based in ZÃ¼rich. 

## R project file ##

All files and folders are based within an R project called 'morality.Rproj'

## Within each experimental folder (exp1, exp2), there are three main R markdown files: ##

1. wrangle.Rmd

This file wrangles raw data, produces some summary data plots, saves out data files for modelling and further analysis in later scripts.

2. models.Rmd

This file builds Bayesian regression models.

3. effects.Rmd

This file visualises and tabulates parameters.

## Within each experimental folder (exp1, exp2), there are five folders, which have largely self-explanatory titles: ##

1. /figures/
2. /tables/
3. /models/
4. /data/
5. /fits/
